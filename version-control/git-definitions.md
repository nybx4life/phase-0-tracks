# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a system that holds specific "versions" of files. 
Version control allows a user or group of users to access these different modifications of files through time
to roll back changes, or address specific issues that has come up in new versions.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of the original project. This allows you to make modifications to the 
original file and view that everything works before merging back to the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit allows you to save your changes to a git project. A good commit message states what
has been changed since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

Merge conflicts happen when separate branches make similar edits to the same file, such as
making changes to the title tag of an HTML page.
